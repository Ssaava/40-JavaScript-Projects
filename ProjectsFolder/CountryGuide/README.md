# Rest Countries API

### Overview

The REST Countries API is a powerful resource that enables us to retrieve comprehensive information about countries worldwide. By utilizing this API, we can seamlessly fetch country data for our website.

### Features of The API

- Country Information: The API provides extensive information about countries, including details such as country codes, names, capitals, currencies, languages spoken, timezones, regional blocs, and much more. This wealth of data allows us to present a holistic view of each country on our website.

- Search Capability: With the REST Countries API, we can search for countries based on various parameters, including country codes, names, and capitals. This search functionality enables users to find specific countries quickly and efficiently.

For our project, we will primarily utilize the country code and name to retrieve the desired country information. These parameters will serve as the main search criteria for fetching the relevant country data.

By leveraging the **REST Countries API**, we can access a vast repository of country data, enabling us to present accurate and up-to-date information to our website users.
