Done with setting up the development environment -->
it is time to start working on the layout and how it will appear using bootstra

we need more than one pages that will be displayed for our data and these pages include
detail page to display the details for one country
the home page that will be used to display all the countries from the API and this is the homepage for the site
Questions to ask myself, can the two pages be displayed in a single page by updating the data in the page?

<!-- we shall have one html file to display all of the required information -->

asynchronously update data in a webpage html -> https://medium.com/geekculture/asynchronously-updating-a-webpage-in-a-standard-html-css-js-frontend-8496a3388c01
