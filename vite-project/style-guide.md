# Your users should be able to:

## Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:

        - Any field is empty
        - The email address is not formatted correctly
    - View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
    - See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
    - Bonus: Hook the form up so it sends and stores the user's enquiry (you can use a spreadsheet or Airtable to save the enquiries)
    - Bonus: Add your own details (image, skills, projects) to replace the ones in the design
